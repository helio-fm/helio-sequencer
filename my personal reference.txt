e.mods.isRightButtonDown()   <- is the right button down?



- make right click and drag delete notes instead of drag

- make middle click drag even in pen mode
	done so far:
		- got it to drag (while placing a note)
		- added isLeftButtonDown() to prevent notes from being entered on anything but a left click

- make crtl+left click drag select even in pen mode
	done so far:
		- changed [bool RollBase::isLassoEvent(const MouseEvent &e) const] to only consider ctrl and left mouse. notes now place as well as lasso start
		- disabled the line of code that places a note no matter what (???) on left click

to delete notes
- select note at e
- delete it!

mouseDown



- removing MidiEventComponent::mouseDown(e);  to PianoRoll.cpp    -->     fucks with placing notes
- adding  if (e.mods.isLeftButtonDown() && e.mods.isCtrlDown())  to PianoRoll.cpp   -> does nothing
