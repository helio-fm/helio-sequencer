[Helio](https://helio.fm) is free and open-source music sequencer, designed to be used on all major platforms.


## Why another sequencer?

Most of the DAW interfaces often seem [overcomplicated](https://mashable.com/archive/german-u-boat), and they only tend to get more and more bloated over time. Many of them are commercial, proprietary-licensed and almost none of them support all major operating systems at the same time.

Helio is an attempt to rethink a music sequencer to create a tool that **feels right**.

It aims to be a modern music creation software, featuring linear-based/pattern-based sequencer with clean UI, integrated version control for synchronizing project between devices, microtonal temperaments support, small portable builds and more; mainly targeted at hobbyist composers, game developers and indie artists.
