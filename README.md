## ![Screenshot](Docs/images/screen-v3.png)
[Helio Workstation](https://helio.fm) is free and open-source music sequencer, designed to be used on all major platforms.


## Why another sequencer?

Most of the DAW interfaces often seem overcomplicated to newcomers, and they only tend to get more and more bloated over time. Many of them are commercial, proprietary-licensed and almost none of them support all major operating systems at the same time.

Helio is an attempt to rethink a music sequencer to create a tool that **feels right**.

It aims to be a modern music creation software, featuring linear-based/pattern-based sequencer with clean UI, integrated version control for synchronizing project between devices, microtonal temperaments support, small portable builds and more; mainly targeted at hobbyist composers, game developers and indie artists.

### Packaging Status

[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/helio-workstation.svg?header=helio-workstation)](https://repology.org/project/helio-workstation/versions)  


## Contributing

Helio is still a work in progress, and there are several ways you could help:

* [Proofread and improve the translation](https://helio.fm/translations) for your native language.

* Maintain a package for your favorite Linux distro - highly appreciated, please see the list of available and missing packages [here](https://repology.org/project/helio-workstation/versions).

* Your thoughts on any usability improvements are welcome: friendly and lightweight UI is the main development priority in this project, so feel free to help me identify the main friction points.

* Implement new features: some guys were asking me if I have any tasks for them to start working on, but, as a sole unpaid developer with limited amount of time and interest, I'm not planning stories or organizing the board, instead I only work on the parts that are fun and important for me at the moment. If you don't know where to start, my suggestion is that you do the same: find a missing feature or behavior you're lacking the most, and make the app a little more convenient for yourself. Anyway, feel free to ask questions and create incomplete PR's to get intermediate feedback.
